**Compling and Running our Project** <br />
For Phase 1, compiling our project will involve using the command line "javac class_name.java" for each class that wants to be ran separately, but will most likely only employ the main runner class, the main method in SocialMediaPlatform. As there is no GUI/visual component yet, the running of our project will be through verifying the success of our methods and a RunLocalTest class. The main method of the SocialMediaPlatform includes the thread-safe implementation and can be run to make the interface more user interactive.
