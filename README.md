- **User.java:**
This class stores all the functionalities of the User objects of our platform, beginning with how a new User of the platform is created. The class also includes functionalities over how the User will add, block, or remove friends. Furthermore, the class includes processing methods, such as a .equals() method for when searching through lists, and a toString() method for displaying the User's information to a file, first, and eventually the GUI interface. The tests that were performed on this class were written either in tests for other classes, or just simply to make sure the accessor, mutator, and functional methods were working. For instance, the method, setUsername() was used in conjunction with a test for the SocialMediaPlatform.java class when testing to make sure the input that the user would eventually type in from a input dialog in our GUI could be modified to represent an acutal username present on existing social media platforms. In another example, the methods that edit the blocked and friends ArrayList fields were simply tested to make sure that our program could create a list of people (for different reasons) for each User that is created for our platform.
