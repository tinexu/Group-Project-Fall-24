- **User.java:**
This class stores all the functionalities of the User objects of our platform, beginning with how a new User of the platform is created. The class also includes functionalities over how the User will add, block, or remove friends. Furthermore, the class includes processing methods, such as a .equals() method for when searching through lists, and a toString() method for displaying the User's information to a file, first, and eventually the GUI interface. The tests that were performed on this class were written either in tests for other classes, or just simply to make sure the accessor, mutator, and functional methods were working. For instance, the method, setUsername() was used in conjunction with a test for the SocialMediaPlatform.java class when testing to make sure the input that the user would eventually type in from a input dialog in our GUI could be modified to represent an acutal username present on existing social media platforms. In another example, the methods that edit the blocked and friends ArrayList fields were simply tested to make sure that our program could create a list of people (for different reasons) for each User that is created for our platform. This class is essentially the information storage center for all the Users created on our platform. It will interact with our messaging class to monitor what friends a User can message via the blocked and friends ArrayLists; it will interact with our post and feed class to monitor whose posts will show up on a specific User's feed; it will also interact with our overarching SocialMediaPlatform class to provide the methods necessary in reading and writing Users to our database, as well as maintaining the data stored in it.
- **SocialMediaPlatform.java:**
This class is the running component for our platform and currently stores the methods that read and write to files in our database when we process data for testing. There are fundamental methods that read an input file and write to an output file, as well as a method that exists as a mediator between reading and writing (i.e. this method takes the username that a User inputs and edits it to represent an actual username on a social media platform). The class also has methods that display Users to the screen, something that will be present when the GUI is implemented. Overall, this class is responsible for getting the input that an individual puts in and pushes out what our whole program processes back to that individual. The tests performed on this class for Phase 1 of this project were focused on making sure that our program can read in input to the backend's database as well as write out what our code processed back to human visibility. For instance, the first test for our reading and writing methods employed an input file with pre-written inputs and expected outputs, and made sure that what was read in matched the input file, as well as made sure that what was written to an output file matched the input file, precisely. The second test employed a method that processed the read input and modified the text a bit (e.g the '@' character was added to each username to represent an actual username that existing social media platforms use, since a user using our program will not intentionally type that character when creating an account. This character will also serve as a useful placemarker for String methods, such as substring). Futhermore, we tested the method that adds users to an instance variable ArrayList, _users_, by, again, creating input and expected output. This function is extremely important, because it serves as the base for the method, in the same class, that displays users to the GUI screen. Another additional test, something that would be better used when implementing our GUI, would be to test our method that displays users to the screen (i.e. for a purpose such as, a list of users that are present on the platform that the first-person user can friend/follow). This class uses other classes, especially the User class, in order to generate what is exactly displayed to our eventual GUI. For example, this class appends new Users to the platform's list of users in order to perform a number of reading and writing processes, and it is currently tied to our Feed class in order to store all of the posts on the platform, for potential future use.
