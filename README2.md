# Group-Project-Fall-24 <br />
_**L30-Team 127: Oscar Katz, Srinidhi Saravanan, Christine Xu**_

**Submission Details** <br />
- For Brightspace: Nothing to be submitted yet.
- For Vocareum: Christine Xu

**Newly Added Interfaces** <br />
- ClientInterface.java: The interface that the Client class will implement.
- ServerInterface.java: The interface that the Server class will implement.
- Runnable: Not an interface that we created, but the Server class will implement it so that our program can be thread-safe.

**Newly Added Classes** <br />
- **Client.java:** <br />
This class will store everything that a client does that interacts with our server/program. The server will process all of the data stored in the database and the data that is given to the server by the client via this class. Client.java serves more to provide the bridge between the server and client by allowing the client to interact with a visual interface. 
- **Server.java:** <br />
This class will contain everything that goes into server processing for our program. For instance, some functionalities might be searching through the ArrayList instance variable of users in order to make sure that login credentials are correct, and that new users are not making a new username with an existing one.

**Compiling and Running Our Project** <br />
For Phase 2, our project will still be outputting to the terminal; however a server and multiple clients (threads) will be implemented through a client class. Both the Server and Client classes will have to be running and compiled in order for our program to compile correctly. When you run our Server class followed by our Client class, you will get options 1-8, these options (in order) are search, post, add a friend, remove a friend, block someone, view your feed, view your account, or log out. If you were to type in 1 (search), you would be taken to another page that would prompt you to enter the text of whom you are searching for. If the User exists in the database you would be shown the User’s username, and the number of friends that User has. Once it displays the User, it would then prompt you to choose between searching for another User or returning to the home page. If you were to type in 2 (Post), you would be asked for the text that you would like to post. Once you input the text that you would like to post, our system would update the files and when you choose to view your account later you would be able to see that post. Once you have made your post, you would be asked if you would like to make another Post or return to the home page. If you were to type in 3 (Add a friend), the system would ask you to type in the username of the friend you would like to add. If the user is already your friend, or you have blocked the user, or the user has blocked you, the program will not let you add the user to your friends list. Otherwise, if the user exists in the database, it will add the user to your friends file, and you to the user’s friends file. The program would then prompt you to choose if you would like to add another friend or return to the home page. If you typed in 4 (Remove a Friend), the program would ask you to input the username of the friend you would like to remove. If the User was never your friend or the User doesn’t exist in the database file, the program would not allow you to remove the friend. Otherwise, the friend would be removed from the file and the user would be removed from the friend’s friend file. The program would then ask you if you’d like to remove someone else or return to the home page. If you were to type in 5 (Block someone), the program would ask the User to input the username of the User they would like to block. If this User exists in the database, and was not already blocked, it would add the User requested to the original user’s blocked file. If the user is trying to block someone who is their friend, it would remove the other user from the friends file (and vice versa) and then add the other user to the user’s blocked file. The program would then ask you if you want to block another user or return to the home page. If you were to type in 6 (View Feed), the program would show you a random post that one of your friends has posted. It would display the number of likes, comments, and dislikes on the post. The program would then ask if you would like to upvote, downvote, or view the comments on this post. If you chose to view the comments you would then have the option of upvoting any of the comments, downvoting any of the comments, adding a comment yourself, or deleting a comment that you have previously written. If you were to try to delete a comment that you did not write, the program would not let you. You would then be asked if you would like to return to the feed or return home. If you were to type in 7 (View my Account), you would be shown your username, the number of friends you have, and all of your posts, as well as how many likes and dislikes each post has. You would then be asked if you would like to delete a comment on any of your posts. If you would like to delete a comment, you would have to enter the index of that comment, and since you are the owner of the post, you would be able to delete any existing comment. You would then be asked if you would like to go back to viewing your account or return to the home page. Finally, if you were to type in 8 (Log Out), the program would prompt you with a confirmation message asking if you are sure, if you type in “Yes” then you would exit the program, otherwise you would return back to the home page.
